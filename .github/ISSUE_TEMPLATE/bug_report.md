* Only the latest version is being supported. If you are using an outdated version, upgrade to the latest version.
* If you find an issue, check whether this issue happens with only this mod. If not, check which mod it's incompatible with.
* The Forge version is not being supported. If you find an issue of the Forge version, check whether the same issue exists for the Fabric version. Forge-version-specific issues belong to  https://github.com/qouteall/ImmersivePortalsModForForge/issues
